# use-reanthesis

Connect your AI to [Reanthesis](https://reanthesis.com), spaced repetition
for serious exams.

Your AI reads your lecture notes, drafts sharp flashcards, and files them into
your decks through the hosted MCP server at `https://reanthesis.com/mcp`. You
open Reanthesis and study. There is nothing to install or run: connecting is a
URL and one **Allow** tap.

## Connect

| Client | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| Claude (claude.ai, desktop, iOS) | Settings → Connectors → **Add custom connector** → `https://reanthesis.com/mcp` |
| ChatGPT | Settings → Connectors (developer mode) → `https://reanthesis.com/mcp` |
| Claude Code | `claude mcp add --transport http reanthesis https://reanthesis.com/mcp` |
| Codex CLI | `codex mcp add reanthesis --url https://reanthesis.com/mcp` |
| VS Code · Copilot | Add an HTTP MCP server with the same URL |

Your browser opens the Reanthesis authorize screen; sign in if needed and tap
**Allow**. You need an existing Reanthesis account — a connector can never
create one, and it can never touch billing or account settings.

## Plugins

For clients with a plugin system, the plugin bundles the connector and the
card-craft skill together, so one install is a complete setup.

Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Reanthesis/use-reanthesis
/plugin install reanthesis@reanthesis
```

Codex CLI: `codex plugin marketplace add Reanthesis/use-reanthesis`, then
`codex plugin add reanthesis@reanthesis` and start a new thread. Copilot CLI
uses the same two `/plugin` commands as Claude Code.

## The skill

[`skills/reanthesis`](skills/reanthesis/SKILL.md) teaches an AI the craft
before it touches a tool: read the whole source, check what
already exists, propose the batch, then create. Two focused references cover
the craft — [creating cards](skills/reanthesis/references/creating-cards.md)
and [waking dormant cards](skills/reanthesis/references/waking-dormant-cards.md),
the loop that keeps a growing collection studyable. Hosted clients without
skills (claude.ai, ChatGPT) receive the same guidance from the server itself
at connection time.

## What your AI can do

The server exposes 13 tools, scoped to card tending:

- `whoami`, `study_status` — connection health and the study dashboard.
- `list_decks`, `create_deck`, `list_cards` — navigate the collection.
- `create_card`, `create_cloze`, `update_card`, `delete_card` — author notes,
  including `{{c1::...}}` cloze deletions.
- `wake_cards`, `rest_cards`, `find_tags` — move material between active
  (in the study queue) and dormant (paused, progress kept), by tag, deck, or
  card.
- `upload_image` — attach diagrams that are themselves the study content.

The full contract is in [docs/mcp-tools.md](docs/mcp-tools.md).

## Auth and privacy

Connecting uses OAuth 2.1 (authorization code + PKCE), discovered
automatically from the server URL. Approval mints an opaque connector token,
stored hashed server-side, valid 180 days, revoked by a password reset. The
token is scoped server-side, deny by default: it can tend cards and read
study state, and the API refuses everything else — account, billing,
membership, exports, imports, and review submission. Your AI builds and tends
cards; only you study them.

Inference stays yours: your AI reads your material with your subscription.
Reanthesis stores cards and study state, schedules with FSRS, and adds no
third-party inference or analytics to this integration. Details in
[docs/auth.md](docs/auth.md).

## Roadmap

- Connector-registry listings, so adding Reanthesis becomes a toggle instead
  of a URL.
- OAuth refresh tokens.
- Image-occlusion and cluster tools.
- Bulk import.
